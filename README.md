# Speech-Diarization-Using-WhisperAI

Using the powerful technologies of Whisper AI, PyAudio, and Gradio, helps automatically separates and labels speakers in audio recordings. üéôÔ∏èüîç With Speech Diarization, we can unlock a new level of understanding in audio data. üìäüí°

Here's how it works:
1. Whisper AI, an exceptional speech recognition system developed by OpenAI, accurately transcribes the audio input, capturing every word spoken.
2. Next, Pyannote.audio, a cutting-edge speaker diarization toolkit, utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to analyze the transcribed audio and identify individual speakers.
3. With the power of Pyannote, the system assigns unique labels to each speaker, enabling you to distinguish and track their contributions throughout the recording.
4. Finally, Gradio, a user-friendly UI tool, is fastest way to deploy your machine learning model with a friendly web interface so that anyone can use it, anywhere!

The applications of Speech Diarization are vast like:
1. Transcription Services: Efficiently transcribe multi-speaker interviews, meetings, and podcasts, saving time and resources.
2. Market Research: Analyze customer interactions, focus groups, and call center recordings to gain valuable insights into consumer behavior and preferences.
3. Legal and Compliance: Facilitate the review process for legal cases, extracting pertinent information from recorded depositions, hearings, and trials.
4. Content Creation: Enhance the editing process for podcasts, videos, and interviews, allowing you to isolate specific speakers or segments effortlessly.

This project exemplifies the power of AI in audio analysis and transcription, making complex tasks simple and efficient.
